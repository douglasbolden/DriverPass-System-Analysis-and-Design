# DriverPass-System-Analysis-and-Design
Portfolio submission for CS-255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The Client was DriverPass owner Liam. They wanted a simple application that would allow users to access a variety of tests (paid) and schedule time with driving instructors in order to improve their chances of success during any DMV test.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe that my best work was in the form of the activity diagrams that were created and the collection of customer requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definitely choose the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the Business Requirements Document. I could easily add a few more possible requirements for both sections. This isn't a major problem, but it just seems like I could possibly find more stuff to add to it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I listened. I took all of the information given to me, and I formulated multiple educated/informed solutions for the problem that was presented before me. I put as much of what the user wanted in, as I could. It is extremely important that you take any possible problem for the user into account as soon as you can. Without implementing what the client wants, the client will not come back to you. Without making the UX/UI attractive, it may make some customers want to avoid using your product.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
UML Design is a MUST. ALL different types of UML diagram make the design that much easier. I will definitely continue to use Activity Diagrams and STACKOVERFLOW. Stack Overflow will always be a friend of any programmer that ever programs. It may not have the answer that you need, but it will help you figure out(hopefully) what you need. The best strategy for analysis and design for a system is to keep all information that is pertinent to the project close. Review this information while acting like you have went on a vacation and imagine that you are someone that never got to talk to the person that designed the document that you are currently holding. Can you read this easily? If not, then you need to revise it, and make it easier for everyone involved.

Thank You.
